# Fingerprint-Recognition-Algorithm
A model for fingerprint image feature extraction is developed by use of cellular automata and these image features are used to compare against a database of images in order to correctly identify whether a sample is a match or not. The code also contains some image processing techniques in MATLAB that were used to enhance the image and improve the performance of the algorithm.
